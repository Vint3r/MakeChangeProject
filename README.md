## Make Change Project

### First week homework for Skill Distillery

The first homework project I had to do for my class in Skill Distillery, its a little clunky in how it does
what it does but it works.

### Overview

This program simulates a cash transaction interface.

### How to run

This program will greet you and create a simple menu displaying the users options,
asking if the user wants to quit, add a item to their 'cart' or pay for everything they currently have.
All that you need to do is type the number for the option you wish (or the word) and follow the prompts
there after. After you are finished putting items in your cart you can pay or quit, if you haven't paid
the program will cancel the transaction and you get nothing, if you pay over the amount it will calculate what
coins and bills you receive as change, and if you pay the exact amount it will tell you so.

### Technologies/topics used

I used a method to do all the math for finding your change due back, with a few while loops and if else if with
a single switch statement to do all the logic for this program.

### Lessons

Learned and practiced with creating and converting different variables along with dealing with the limitations of
the different types of variables such as doubles. I also tried to add a bit of error handling, albeit maybe
not as much as it should need but some to try and keep the program from crashing if the user doesn't input what
it wants.
